How do I approach designing software?

When it comes to my approach to desinging software, making sure to follow proper coding guidelines will be important. Making sure that I comment in the code to make viewing it easier not just for me, but other users that view it. The use of iteration to call for the shapes to be draw can be used in my future works, for reducing code is an important process when coding.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs with the goal of making readable and correct code, and by using iteration, allow for the reduction of the same code by having functions that could call code. As I worked through the milestones, the knowledge gained help bring my work together. Allowing me to use prior functions and adding to them to create the 3D scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me reach my goals by allowing me to take what I've learned and then by coding it, such as in the work done this semseter, show me a visual representation of my work and my accumilated knowledge. With this I can start to gain confidence in myself as I move forward, whether that be educationally or professionally.
